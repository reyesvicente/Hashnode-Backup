This assignment is a challenge because I do not listen to pop music. However, I have heard of Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars but never really listened to it alone, in a quiet room with dim lights. 

The intro made my neck move to the groove of the song while tapping two fingers together. The feel-good feeling of the song made my legs move with the groove. My body was also moving with the chair.

I felt goosebumps on my arms throughout my head when the chorus was playing. To validate what I felt, I sat straight on my chair. I still felt that feel-good happy-dancy music, which I felt at the start.

By the end of the song, I got distracted by my dog, who was scratching the bottom of the door from outside. It is a sign that he is hungry.
