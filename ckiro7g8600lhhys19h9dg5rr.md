## What I built

I rebuilt my new portfolio in the past 2 or 3 weeks. When I read about the [announcement](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k) of the #dohackathon, I told myself, f*ck it. I'll submit this website, just for experience.

### Description

This website was built to showcase my past works as a freelance developer and to justify the rate to clients.

## Background

My old portfolio came from a JAMSTACK template and was built on Gatsby and only had more or less 50 form inquiries hence the decision to rebuilt my portfolio. 


### How I built it 
The website is hosted on DigitalOcean's App Platform. 
I built the website using ReactJS, TailwindCSS, DatoCMS, GraphQL, Airtable, Mailchimp, Hubspot, Zapier, Discord, Cloudflare and AWS Cloudfront. Wew. 

Airtable is used as a database for the form submissions. I get notified on my discord when a user submits an inquiry on the contact form, which will then populate the tables on airtable. Then, an email will be sent from mailchimp that will get more information about what they need. Hubspot is used as a calendar and a more detailed form from the CTA at the header.

Aside from rebranding my old site, I built my new site to learn all the tech that I mentioned above, except for the Zapier, Mailchimp, Hubspot and Discord integrations.
