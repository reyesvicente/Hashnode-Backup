My idea of freelancing was posting ads on different platforms like [Fiver](https://fiverr.com), [Outsourcely](http://otsly.co/p3Y4J), Guru & [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/get/reyesvicente?f=give) then sleep.. Kidding, then develop my skills and build more projects while waiting for that notification that someone has accepted my bid. But..

## I was wrong.

I started freelancing as a Ghost Producer and Mix/Mastering Engineer on Fiver and was having fun until I received a 3 star which levelled me below the threshold for sending bids to buyers.

1 week passed.. 2 weeks.. 3 weeks.. 
# No notification arrived even if I did mass advertising on social media groups.

### I then decided to go back to what I started in college and study some codes while allotting 2 hours for honing my Audio Skills. :smirk::smirk:

6 weeks passed. I learned some fundamentals of html/css, attended some classes on Udemy and LinkedIn Learning. Still no gigs.

## The other day..

I bumped into my gym trainer and had a quick chat on why I haven't worked out for quite sometime. I mentioned that I lost my job and that I miss working out and in fact, I bought a jump rope for to give time to work outs at home. 

I made a segway and showed him the sites I've built and how I host them on AWS S3 and that I just need to figure out how to link my domain names to the s3 domains provided by AWS to be able to host friends' websites for an affordable price. 

After a few more conversations, he mentioned someone at the gym whom he trains that owns [a business that sells residential & commercial lights and lamps](https://www.facebook.com/SOLARLAMPSANDLIGHTING/) and that I should shoot him a message on Facebook to gather info wether they need it a website re-designed, managed or developed. To my excite, I cut the conversation and mentioned I had errands so I had to go but before parting, I told him that I'll be working out the in the next couple of days and that I will be needing his help.

I immediately switched on my Mini and logged in to Facebook to send the guy a message about my interest in developing & designing their company website. As I was doing a quick background check on their Company Page, their products can be seen on 8 stores around the metro but their main office is 3 hours away from where I stay!:expressionless::expressionless:

My casual proposal is about 5-7 pages then connect a local API for their local deliveries and payment or use Shopify or develop a [Jekyll Theme](http://wowthemes.pxf.io/c/1348602/430741/7553?u=https%3A%2F%2Fjekyllthemes.io%2Fpremium) to make my life easier. But I'd prefer to develop the site on my own to gain experience.


Next stop is to finish my proposal from [Proposify](https://vagrys.proposify.com/referral), finish my UI's & develop my developer skills.

Cheers!
