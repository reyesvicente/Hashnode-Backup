A few hours ago, I was asked by a senior Django developer what the difference of OneToOneField, ForeignKey and ManyToManyField. I believe I gave a pretty good explanation about it so here I am writing about it for you.

When working with **Django models**, relationships between tables are essential to structure your data properly. Django provides three main types of relationships: **OneToOneField**, **ForeignKey**, and **ManyToManyField**. Knowing when and how to use them is key to building scalable and maintainable applications.

In this post, weâ€™ll break them down with simple explanations and examples.

## ðŸ”— OneToOneField

A **One-to-One relationship** means that one record in a model is linked to exactly one record in another model.

Think of it as an **extension of a model**.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: A `User` profile where each user has exactly **one profile**.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    bio = models.TextField()
    birthdate = models.DateField()
```

* Each `User` can have only **one Profile**.
    
* If the `User` is deleted, the related `Profile` will also be deleted (`CASCADE`).
    
* Useful for adding extra information to a model without altering its original definition.

## ðŸ”— ForeignKey

A **ForeignKey** represents a **One-to-Many relationship**. One record in a model can be related to multiple records in another model.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: A blog where one `Author` can have many `Posts`.

```python
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Post(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
```

* One `Author` can write many `Posts`.
    
* Each `Post` belongs to exactly **one Author**.
    
* Deleting the `Author` deletes all their posts (because of `CASCADE`).

## ðŸ”— ManyToManyField

A **Many-to-Many relationship** means multiple records in one model can be related to multiple records in another model.

ðŸ‘‰ Example: A `Student` can enroll in many `Courses`, and each `Course` can have many `Students`.

```python
class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Course(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    students = models.ManyToManyField(Student, related_name="courses")
```

* A student can be in multiple courses.
    
* A course can have multiple students.
    
* Django creates an **intermediate table** automatically to handle these relationships.

## ðŸ“Š Quick Comparison

| Relationship | Field Type | Example | Real-World Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One-to-One | `OneToOneField` | `User` â†” `Profile` | Extending user models, passports, IDs |
| One-to-Many | `ForeignKey` | `Author` â†’ `Post` | Blogs, comments, categories |
| Many-to-Many | `ManyToManyField` | `Student` â†” `Course` | Tags, memberships, playlists |

## âœ… Final Thoughts

* Use **OneToOneField** when each record should be uniquely linked to another record.
    
* Use **ForeignKey** when one object should be related to many others.
    
* Use **ManyToManyField** when both sides of the relationship can have multiple connections.
    

Understanding these fields helps you design cleaner, more efficient database schemas in Djangoâ€”and prevents headaches down the road.
