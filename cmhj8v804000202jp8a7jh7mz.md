The other day, while I was biking, an idea popped into my head: Why don’t I use AI to write pseudo code, then solve the problem using that? So I did it! I went to [Claude](https://claude.ai) told me to generate 10 small Python problems that I can practice on. My prompt? I want to hone my problem-solving skills. Can you create me basic problems in Python so I can practice? And voila, [Claude](https://claude.ai/) created me a set of python projects from beginner to intermediate problems to help me hone my problem solving skills!

After [Claude](https://claude.ai/) generated the problems, it also taught me how to use them:

**How to practice:**

1. Work through each problem one at a time.
    
2. Try to solve it without looking at solutions first.
    
3. Test your code with the examples provided
    
4. Once you've solved a problem, you can ask me to review your solution or provide hints if you get stuck.
    

After that, [Claude](https://claude.ai) told me what the problems covered:

**What these problems cover:**

1. Basic string and number manipulation
    
2. Lists and data structures
    
3. Loops and conditionals
    
4. Logic and algorithm thinking
    
5. Working with built-in functions
    

The goal here is to condition my mind into learning how to be a problem solver rather than letting AI do everything. I start off with 10 basic problems, which I’ll explain later in the article. I plan to do this for a few months to a year with random times I’ll be doing [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/icenreyes) just like what I did the other day.

Listed below are the problems, their difficulty, and topics covered:

| 1 | Sum of Digits | Beginner | Loops, Math |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Palindrome Checker | Beginner | String[s, Log](https://claude.ai/)ic |
| 3 | Find Missing Number | Beginner | Lists, Math |
| 4 | [Count Vo](https://claude.ai/)wels | Beg[inners](https://claude.ai/) | St[rings,](https://claude.ai/) Loops |

I know, I could have just gone with [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/icenreyes) for the challenges, but believe me or not, those challenges are more difficult for me than the ones generated by [Claude](https://claude.ai/). You might also think that the point of doing challenges is to hone your problem-solving skills, but the point of doing challenges is to get better at problem-solving as a beginner. I haven’t been consistent in coding since 2019, so I know what my limits are.

You may think that [Claude](https://claude.ai/) would give me direct code to write, but look at this sample pseudo code it generated for me:

```python
        for i from 1 to n (inclusive):
            if i is divisible by both 3 and 5:
                append "FizzBuzz" to results
            else if i is divisible by 3:
                append "Fizz" to results
            else if i is divisible by 5:
                append "Buzz" to results
            else:
                append i to results
```

I did not understand the first line `for i from 1 to n (inclusive):` and it took me a few minutes to know what that means. You know what that means? `for i in range(1, n + 1):` Get my point? It get’s easier as I maneuver through the problems.

### **Conclusion**

This little experiment reminded me that AI doesn’t have to be a shortcut — it can be a learning partner. By letting [Claude](https://claude.ai/) generate pseudo code and guide me through structured problem-solving, I get to focus on the **thinking** part rather than just syntax or memorization. It’s not about replacing the effort but reinforcing it with smarter tools.

As I continue this journey, my goal is simple: rebuild my consistency, sharpen my logic, and rediscover the fun of solving problems one line of code at a time. I’ll be breaking down each problem soon — from the pseudo code to the final solution — so stay tuned for the next article.
