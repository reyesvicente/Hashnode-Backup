When working with image uploads in a Django project, there may be situations where you need to enforce specific dimensions, such as ensuring the uploaded image is **rectangular** (not square). This can be particularly useful for profile headers, banners, or media requiring non-square formats.

In this article, weâ€™ll walk through a simple solution using Django's validation system and the **Pillow** library.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the solution, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **Django** (for web framework functionality)
    
2. **Pillow** (for image processing)
    

If you donâ€™t have Pillow installed, you can add it using:

```python
python -m pip install pillow
```

# Writing the Validator

To validate whether an uploaded image is rectangular, we need to check the **width** and **height** of the image. If both dimensions are equal, it means the image is square, and weâ€™ll raise a validation error.

Hereâ€™s the code for the custom validator:

```python
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from PIL import Image

def validate_rectangular_image(image):
    """
    Validator to ensure an uploaded image is rectangular and not square.
    """
    image = Image.open(image)  # Open the uploaded image using Pillow
    width, height = image.size  # Extract dimensions
    
    if width == height:  # Check if image is square
        raise ValidationError("Uploaded image must be rectangular (not square).")
    
    return image
```

## Integrating the Validator with a Django Model

To use this validator in your Django application, you can add it to a model field. For instance, letâ€™s assume you have an ImageField in a model for a user profile banner:

```python
from django.db import models
from .validators import validate_rectangular_image  # Import the custom validator

class Profile(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    banner_image = models.ImageField(
        upload_to='banners/', 
        validators=[validate_rectangular_image],
        help_text="Please upload a rectangular image for the banner."
    )
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

### How It Works:

* The `validate_rectangular_image` function is called whenever a file is uploaded to the `banner_image` field.
    
* If the image is square, a `ValidationError` is raised, preventing the file from being saved.
    
* Only rectangular images will pass validation and be uploaded successfully.
    

## Handling Validation Errors in Forms

If youâ€™re using Django forms for image uploads, the error will be displayed to users when they submit an invalid image.

For example, a simple form could look like this:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Profile

class ProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Profile
        fields = ['name', 'banner_image']
```

When a user uploads a square image, they will see the error message:

> **"Uploaded image must be rectangular (not square)."**

## Testing the Validator

You can test the functionality by trying to upload both square and rectangular images.

1. **Square Image (e.g., 300x300):**  
    The validator will reject the file and raise a `ValidationError`.
    
2. **Rectangular Image (e.g., 400x300):**  
    The validator will accept the file, and the image will be uploaded successfully.
    

## Conclusion

By using this approach, you can enforce image dimension requirements seamlessly in your Django applications. The `Pillow` library makes it easy to work with image sizes, and Django's validation system allows you to integrate custom logic without much effort.

### Key Takeaways:

* Use **Pillow** to extract image dimensions.
    
* Raise `ValidationError` when an uploaded image fails your criteria.
    
* Integrate validators into Django models to ensure data integrity.

By combining Django and Pillow, you can create powerful and flexible image upload rules that enhance the quality of your web applications.
