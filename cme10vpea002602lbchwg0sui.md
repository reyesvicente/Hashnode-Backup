## **🎵 What Are Intervals?**

An **interval** is the **distance between two notes**.

### **🎯 Example:**

* C to E → **Major 3rd**
    
* E to G → **Minor 3rd**
    

Each interval has a **sound** and a **shape** on the guitar.

## **🧠 Music Theory Basics (Know These First)**

* `1 semitone = 1 fret`
    
* `1 whole step = 2 frets`
    
* Musical alphabet: `A B C D E F G`
    
* Enharmonic notes: `C# = Db`, `D# = Eb`, etc.
    
* Major scale formula: `W W H W W W H` *(W = whole step, H = half step)*

## **📊 Common Intervals to Memorize**

| Interval Name | Semitones | Example (C as root) | Sound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perfect Unison | 0 | C - C | Same note |
| Minor 2nd | 1 | C - Db | Very tense |
| Major 2nd | 2 | C - D | Step up |
| Minor 3rd | 3 | C - Eb | Sad/somber |
| Major 3rd | 4 | C - E | Happy |
| Perfect 4th | 5 | C - F | Suspenseful |
| Tritone | 6 | C - F# | Dissonant/devilish |
| Perfect 5th | 7 | C - G | Strong/powerful |
| Minor 6th | 8 | C - Ab | Warm/sad |
| Major 6th | 9 | C - A | Sweet |
| Minor 7th | 10 | C - Bb | Jazzy/tension |
| Major 7th | 11 | C - B | Dreamy/leading |
| Octave | 12 | C - C | Same pitch class |

## **🎸 Interval Shapes on Guitar (E & A Strings)**

Assume you're starting from the **6th string (E)** or **5th string (A)**:

* **Root + Major 2nd** → 2 frets forward, same string
    
* **Root + Major 3rd** → 1 string down, 1 fret back *(diagonal)*
    
* **Root + Perfect 5th** → 1 string down, 2 frets forward *(power chord)*
    
* **Root + Octave** → 2 strings down, 2 frets forward

## **🧠 How to Practice Intervals (Daily Routine)**

### **1\. Learn shapes on one string**

* Pick a root (e.g., G)
    
* Play: G → A (M2), G → B (M3), G → C (P4), etc.
    
* Ascend and descend
    

### **2\. Sing them aloud**

* Play and say: “G → B… Major 3rd”
    
* Builds ear training
    

### **3\. Practice within a scale**

* C Major scale: C–D–E–F–G–A–B–C
    
* Try jumps: C → E (M3), D → F (m3), E → G (m3), etc.
    

### **4\. Apply to chords**

* Major chord = Root + M3 + P5
    
* Minor chord = Root + m3 + P5
    

### **5\. Improvise with intervals**

* Pick 2 intervals (e.g., M3 & P5)
    
* Create short melodic phrases

| Interval | Song (Ascending) |
| --- | --- |
| Minor 2nd | *Jaws* theme |
| Major 2nd | *Happy Birthday* |
| Minor 3rd | *Greensleeves* |
| Major 3rd | *When the Saints Go Marching In* |
| Perfect 4th | *Here Comes the Bride* |
| Tritone | *The Simpsons* theme |
| Perfect 5th | *Star Wars* theme |
| Octave | *Somewhere Over the Rainbow* |

## **🧐 “Isn’t C to E a Major 4th?”**

**Nope. It’s a *Major 3rd***. Let’s break it down:

### **✅ Why?**

In music theory, intervals are based on **letter names**, not just fret count.

### **C to E:**

* C → D → E = **3 letter steps** → It’s a **3rd**
    
* Count semitones:
    
    * C → C# → D → D# → E = **4 semitones**
        

**→ 4 semitones = Major 3rd**

---

## **🤯 Why Not Go by Frets Only?**

Fret count gives you **semitones**, not the **interval class**.

* C to E = 4 semitones = **Major 3rd**
    
* C to F = 5 semitones = **Perfect 4th**
    

> Even though both are only 1 fret apart, they’re **different intervals**.

## **📏 Visual: C Major Scale Reference**

| Note | Distance from C | Interval | Semitones |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C | 0 | Unison | 0 |
| D | 2nd | Major 2nd | 2 |
| E | 3rd | Major 3rd | 4 |
| F | 4th | Perfect 4th | 5 |
| G | 5th | Perfect 5th | 7 |
| A | 6th | Major 6th | 9 |
| B | 7th | Major 7th | 11 |
| C | Octave | Octave | 12 |

## **🎸 On the Fretboard**

* C = 8th fret on 6th string
    
* E = 12th fret → 4 frets higher = **4 semitones = Major 3rd**
