## 🎵 What Are Intervals?

An **interval** is the **distance between two notes**.

Example:

* From **C to E** is a **major 3rd**.
    
* From **E to G** is a **minor 3rd**.
    

Each interval has a **sound** and a **shape** on the guitar.

## 🧠 Know These First (Music Theory Basics)

* **1 semitone = 1 fret**
    
* **Whole step = 2 frets**
    
* The **musical alphabet**: A B C D E F G
    
* Enharmonic notes: C# = Db, D# = Eb, etc.
    
* **Major scale formula**: W W H W W W H  
    (W = whole step, H = half step)

## 📊 Common Intervals (You Should Memorize)

| Interval Name | Semitones | Example (C as root) | Sound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perfect Unison | 0 | C - C | Same note |
| Minor 2nd | 1 | C - Db | Very tense |
| Major 2nd | 2 | C - D | Step up |
| Minor 3rd | 3 | C - Eb | Sad/somber |
| Major 3rd | 4 | C - E | Happy |
| Perfect 4th | 5 | C - F | Suspenseful |
| Tritone | 6 | C - F# | Dissonant/devilish |
| Perfect 5th | 7 | C - G | Strong/powerful |
| Minor 6th | 8 | C - Ab | Warm/sad |
| Major 6th | 9 | C - A | Sweet |
| Minor 7th | 10 | C - Bb | Jazzy/tension |
| Major 7th | 11 | C - B | Dreamy/leading |
| Octave | 12 | C - C | Same pitch class |

## 🎸 Interval Shapes on Guitar (E & A Strings)

Let’s say you’re starting on the **6th string (E)** or **5th string (A)**:

* **Root + Major 2nd** = 2 frets forward, same string
    
* **Root + Major 3rd** = 1 string down, 1 fret back (diagonal shape)
    
* **Root + Perfect 5th** = 1 string down, 2 frets forward (power chord!)
    
* **Root + Octave** = 2 strings down, 2 frets forward
    

We can make a **diagram** if needed for visualization.

## 🧠 How to Practice Intervals (Daily Routine)

1. **Learn them by shape (on one string):**
    
    * Pick a root note (e.g., G)
        
    * Play G → A (M2), G → B (M3), G → C (P4), etc.
        
    * Do this ascending and descending
        
2. **Sing them aloud**:
    
    * Play and sing the interval: “G → B… Major 3rd”
        
    * Helps with ear training
        
3. **Practice interval jumps within a scale**:
    
    * In C Major: C–D–E–F–G–A–B–C
        
    * Play C → E (M3), D → F (m3), E → G (m3), etc.
        
4. **Apply it to chords**:
    
    * Major chord = Root + M3 + P5
        
    * Minor chord = Root + m3 + P5
        
5. **Improvise with intervals**:
    
    * Choose two intervals (e.g., M3 and P5)
        
    * Try creating a melody using only those

## 🎧 Bonus: Learn to Hear Them

Use common songs to remember intervals:

| Interval | Song (Ascending) |
| --- | --- |
| Minor 2nd | *Jaws* theme |
| Major 2nd | *Happy Birthday* |
| Minor 3rd | *Greensleeves* |
| Major 3rd | *When the Saints Go Marching In* |
| Perfect 4th | *Here Comes the Bride* |
| Tritone | *Simpsons* theme |
| Perfect 5th | *Star Wars* theme |
| Octave | *Somewhere Over the Rainbow* |

### Isn't C to E a major 4th? Counting the frets it says 4

Great observation — but let me clear this up:

### ❓ Is C to E a **major 4th**?

**Nope. C to E is a *Major 3rd***, not a major 4th.

---

### ✅ Here's why:

In **music theory**, intervals are **counted by letter names**, not just fret numbers.

#### Example:

From **C to E**:

* C → D → E = 1 → 2 → 3 (3 letter steps)
    
* So it's a **third** (not a fourth).
    
* Now we count the **semitones**:
    
    * C → C# (1)
        
    * C# → D (2)
        
    * D → D# (3)
        
    * D# → E (4)  
        → **4 semitones = Major 3rd**
        

---

### 🤯 Why not go by frets only?

Because fret numbers alone **don’t tell you the interval type by name**, just the distance in semitones.

For example:

* 5 semitones = **Perfect 4th** (like C → F)
    
* 4 semitones = **Major 3rd** (like C → E)
    
* But both are 4 or 5 frets away — and that doesn’t define the **interval class** (2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.)

### 📏 Visual: C Major Scale

```plaintext
mathematicaCopyEditC - D - E - F - G - A - B - C
```

| Note | Distance from C | Interval | Semitones |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C | 0 | Unison | 0 |
| D | 2nd | Major 2nd | 2 |
| E | 3rd | Major 3rd | 4 |
| F | 4th | Perfect 4th | 5 |
| G | 5th | Perfect 5th | 7 |
| A | 6th | Major 6th | 9 |
| B | 7th | Major 7th | 11 |
| C | Octave | Octave | 12 |

---

### 🎸 So on the fretboard...

* C (8th fret on 6th string)
    
* E is 4 frets up = 12th fret
    
* That’s 4 semitones = **Major 3rd**
    

✔ **Semitones define the *quality*** (major, minor, perfect, etc.)  
✔ **Letter names define the *number*** (2nd, 3rd, 4th...)
